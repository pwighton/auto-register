- A reference scan exists with affine transformation A_r. (A_r
  transforms an axis-oriented and centered image of the object into
  the reference scan).
- A subsequent scan is taken of the same object, potentially at a
  different position and orientation than the reference scan. Call the
  associated affine transformation A_s.
- Our goal is to acquire aligned subsequent scans such that the
  associated affine transformation A_a == A_r.
