    class TerminalInput(__builtin__.object)
     |  Allow the user to interact with a terminal in sane ways.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, disabled)
     |      Perform initialization by setting up threading and setting
     |      attributes of the terminal to stop echo and exit cannonical
     |      mode. Setting the disabled flag to True will stop the terminal
     |      attributes from being set. This is useful for debugging, as
     |      you can't input sanely to a debugger when the attributes are
     |      set.
     |  
     |  get_char(self)
     |      Retrieve the next available character that was input by the user,
     |      or None if there was no character since the last call.
     |  
     |  run(self)
     |  
     |  start(self)
     |  
     |  stop(self)
