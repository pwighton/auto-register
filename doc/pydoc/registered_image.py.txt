Help on module registered_image:

NAME
    registered_image

FILE
    /home/ohinds/projects/auto_register/src/registered_image.py

DESCRIPTION
    Register two images by calling out to a helper executable (default
    is mri_robust_register). The resulting transformation is read from the
    output file generated by the registration executable, and made
    available to other modules.
    
    This file can also be used in standalone mode for testing or
    reproducing the AutoRegister behavior.

CLASSES
    RegisteredImage
    
    class RegisteredImage
     |  Class that registers two images and stores info about the registration.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, reference, movable, opts=None, verbose=False)
     |      Setup for performing registrations.
     |  
     |  get_transform(self)
     |      Retrieve a 4x4 numpy matrix representing the most recently computed
     |      transform.
     |  
     |  get_transform_filename(self)
     |      Return the name of the most recently computed transform.
     |  
     |  register(self)
     |      Call out to the external program to register the reference and
     |      movable images.
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Class methods defined here:
     |  
     |  check_environment(cls) from __builtin__.classobj
     |      Make sure that our environment is able to execute the registration
     |      program.
     |  
     |  read_transform_file(cls, filename) from __builtin__.classobj
     |      Read and LTA file and parse the transformation it contains.

FUNCTIONS
    main(argv)
        During standalone operation, build all the arguments that would
        normally be passed in from the calling module and pass them into a
        RegisteredImage class instance.
