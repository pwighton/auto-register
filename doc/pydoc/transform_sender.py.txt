        TransformSender
    
    class TransformSender(__builtin__.object)
     |  Sends a transformation to an external computer. At the moment, this
     |  transformation is only suitable for use in the Siemens AutoAlign
     |  system (or other systems that use a compatible coordinate system).
     |  
     |  This "sender" is actually a TCP server that listens for "ping"
     |  requests from an external receiver. When a transform is available
     |  to send, the server responds to the ping request by transmitting
     |  the transform.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, host, port)
     |      Initialize the networking parameters and internal state.
     |  
     |  clear_state(self)
     |      Set the interal state to an empty string (allowing transformations
     |      to be sent).
     |  
     |  process_data(self, sock)
     |      Callback when a "ping" request is received. This checks that the
     |      request bytes are actually "ping", and replies with the string
     |      "none" if there are no transforms queued for sending, and
     |      otherwise sends the first transform available.
     |  
     |  send(self, transform)
     |      Queue a transform for sending to an external requestor.
     |  
     |  set_state(self, state)
     |      Set the internal state of the sender. If the state is anything
     |      other than an empty string, no transforms will be sent. This
     |      is useful for disabling sending old transforms while an image
     |      registration or network transfer is in progress.
     |  
     |  start(self)
     |  
     |  stop(self)

     |  Data descriptors defined here:

     |  
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)
